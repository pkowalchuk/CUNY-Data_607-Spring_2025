## Overview

The tidyverse function I am going to look at is `between` from dplyr.

## Load the Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```


## Between Function

I chose `between` becuase it's a way more efficient way to do x >= left & x <= right which I tend to do a lot.

Let's test out the between function using `nycflights`:

```{r}
filter(nycflights, between(distance, 800, 1500))
```

Now we can easily see the filtered distance flights without typing out distance >= 800 & x <= 1500.
